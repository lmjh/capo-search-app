# Capo Chord Search Application

The purpose of this site is to provide a useful utility for beginner and intermediate guitarists, to help them play a wider range of songs with the most basic chord shapes that all beginner guitarists learn. 

Most guitarists start by learning the following nine basic chords, known as ‘open chords’: A, Am, C, D, Dm, E, Em, F, and G. However, there are six more major chords and nine more minor chords. To play these, guitarists have to use more complex and difficult ‘barre chords’. 

As an alternative, many guitarists use a tool called a ‘capo’, which raises the pitch of the strings depending on which fret it’s attached to. Using a capo, a guitarist can use easy open chords to play a song that would normally require challenging barre chords. For example, a song that called for a C#, an F# and a B chord could be played easily with the A, D and G chord shapes and a capo on the fourth fret.

There are eleven potential positions for a capo, each providing a unique set of transposed open chords, so it can be very time consuming for a guitarist to check each one to see if there are good options for the particular set of chords they want to play. 

This site aims to solve this problem by allowing a user to select a target set of chords and then quickly displaying any and all simplified methods of playing that set of chords using a capo.
